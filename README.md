# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code
I really enjoyed troubleshooting all of my issues for this challenge. It was VERY frustrating at first trying to understand what was wrong with my code, but with all of the past chalenges under my belt; i was able to get closer and closer to understanding where the issues originated from. Also discovered just how useful console.log is since this was the only reason I was able to understand my issues. Overall, this is was a great learning experience because it gave me further understanding of javascript as well as refining my trouble shooting skills.
